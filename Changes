Revision history for Perl extension MAth::Geometry::Planar.

1.00  Fri Sep  6 14:36:09 2002
	- First relesaseon

1.01  Fri Sep 27 12:40:17 2002
	- Changed Math::Geometry_2D to Math::Geometry::Planar

1.02  Fri Sep 27 14:37:25 2002
	- Include the triangulation code (which was a separate
          .pl file) into the module code

1.03  Tue Oct  1 09:30:15 2002
	- Corrected some typos in POD
        - Added some initialization statements to overcome
          'Use of uninitialized value' warnings during tests

1.04  Tue Oct  1 14:18:05 2002
	- Corrected some typos in POD
        - Different approach for running tests - trying
          to get rid of 'dubious' thing for linux 2.4.16-6mdksmp i386-linux
          (although there is not a 'real' problem afaik)

1.05  Sun Oct  6 14:16:47 2002
	- Adapted module to registered namespace for GPC
          (Math::Geometry::GPC)

1.06  Mon Oct  7 09:50:12 2002
	- Small change in Makefile.PL for correct GPC version in PREREQ_PM

1.07  Mon Oct  7 14:10:02 2002
	- Small change in tests

1.08  Mon Oct  7 14:12:02 2002
	- another attempt to fix linux 2.4.16-6mdksmp i386-linux test
          (nothing is - imho - wrong though ...)

1.09  Mon Oct 14 11:05:34 2002
	- polygons operations now return polygon (contour) objects
          and leave the original object unaltered
          Method triangulate returns a list of polygon (contour)
          objects.
        - fixed a few bugs
            - point missing in result convexhull2 (except for some
              special cases like the one in the tests ...)
            - typo in move made it work only for polygon objects and
              not for contour objects

1.10  Fri May  9 09:30:00 2003
	- Optimized PolygonArea for better performance
          as suggested by C. David Tallman (thanks David)

1.11  Mon Jun 15 10:17:00 2003
	- Added Eric Wilhelm's polygon offset module
        - Moved GPC module under Planar
        - Added precision to parallel and intersection routines
        - Added ray intersection and all combinations of
          ray/line/segment intersection

1.12  Fry Jun 15 11:07:00 2003
	- Added tests for all intersections (ray/line/segment)

1.13  Wed Jun 16 17:05:00 2004

1.14  Fry Jun 18 12:14:00 2004
        - Fixed bug in GPC2polygons function reported by C. Pettir
          ticket 6250

1.15  Wed Dec 14 17:31:00 2005
        - Fixed bug in inside function reported by Sharaba Avshalom
          inconsistent results for when point tested is colinear
          with an edge of the polygon.

1.16  Mon Dec 19 16:10:00 2005
        - Finally got the inside function right
          Points on the perimeter evaluate as being inside

1.17  Thu Jul 16 12:05:00 2009
        - Bug reported by T. Fawcet
          convexhull2 method returns too many points in some
	  cases

1.18  Thu Mar 10 17:27:00 2011
        - Bug reported by M. Henning
          Intermittent segfaults
